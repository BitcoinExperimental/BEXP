BitcoinExperimental - this is a real decentralized system that can work both on the CPUs, GPUs, and on the HDDs. Our goal is to provide the means of everyone who has at least one of the three types of mining, so that in the future the end user can benefit. Both in the form of dividends and in the form of long-term storage.

Especially for this system, a proprietary algorithm was developed that allows you to mine simultaneously (or in pairs) in the directions indicated above.
BESA is a system of intellectual development, it determines the configuration of your system and makes changes to your wallet for the best result, without violating the quality of the Internet connection, and without loading your working system.
You can read more below with the new algorithm and deployment system, download our wallet.

-absolute decentralization from any interventions from outside
-security and anonymity
-the opportunity to work on CPUs, GPUs or HDDs together or separately
-lack of need for mining pools, explorer. Everything is already in the deployment system
-the system will work even at the lowest Internet speed, making it possible for people with low technological progress to make coins

How to start mining on CPU/GPU/HDD
-download and run wallet
-wait for the wallet to load (at the moment - from 30 minutes to 3 hours). The future will be much faster.
-go to settings, select "mining on the CPU/GPU/HDD"
-follow the instructions. The setup process takes an average of 10 to 40 minutes.
